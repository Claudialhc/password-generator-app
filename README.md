This template was to design, using only Javascript, a generate top security random passwords for employees with acces to sensitive adata. The criteria was for the passwords to provide them with greater security. 

When you open the site, you will encounter a box designed to generate random passwords. To get your unique high security password click the "Generate Password" red button. When you click the button you will see pop-up windows at the middle top section of the page. The series of windows that appear depend on how complex you want your password to be. The suggested password criteria are: 
<ul>
    <li>How many characters do you want?</li>
    <li>Do you whant special characters?</li>
    <li>Do you want numeric characters?</li>
    <li>Do you want uppercase letters?</li>
    <li>Do you want lowercase letters?</li>
</ul>

These pop-ups were created with prompts, alerts and confirm javascript elements. There are also for loops and while loops involved to be able to make the prompt, alerts and confirms take de the deisred sequence. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to make the actually make a random generated password to work.
